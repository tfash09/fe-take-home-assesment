# Academy Device Health Dashboard

This project is a Vue 3 application that displays device health metrics across academies. It features a device table, battery health badge, priority color indicators, and more. The application is styled using Tailwind CSS and includes unit tests for key components.

## ðŸš€ Design Overview

### ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The app provides a dashboard to monitor devices used in an academy. Each device has a health status, usage statistics, and can be sorted and visually represented using color-coded badges.

### ðŸ§© Components

- **DeviceTable.vue**: Displays a list of devices for an academy including serial numbers, battery health, average usage, and reading count.
- **BatteryHealthBadge.vue**: Renders a badge based on battery health status (`healthy`, `unhealthy`, `unknown`).

### ðŸ›  Assumptions

- Device health statuses are limited to `healthy`, `unhealthy`, and `unknown`.
- Average daily usage over `30%` is considered high (and marked in red).
- Devices are sorted first by health status, then by usage.
- The application is modular and ready to consume real data from an API (currently mock data is used in tests).
